# SQLProjects
In this reporsitory I will showcase all my projects with the hopes of obtaining feedback in order to improve my coding skills

My first of many projects was the "Library Management System". In this project I develop a Library Management System that would allow a normal Library to manage their book inventory.
For that I have created and developed a database to provide a quick and convenient Library catalog.
Please notice that all data inputed in this database was created randomly apart from Book Titles and itâ€™s publication dates.
